Computational thinking is an essential prerequisite for anyone wanting to learn to program computers and write code. 
This workshop will take you through the steps to think in a computational mindset.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the steps involved in computational thinking
- Break a problem down into more manageable parts
- Develop a series of steps (an *algorithm*) to solve the problem
- Generalise the steps to make the algorithm re-usable (*abstraction*)
