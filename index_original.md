# Introducing Computational Thinking

{% include figure.html img="postits.jpg" alt="Sticky notes on a wall"  width="55%" %}

#### Topic and aims

Once you have completed this introductory workshop on computational thinking, you should be able to:

- Identify the steps involved in computational thinking
- Break a problem down into more manageable parts
- Develop a series of steps (also known an `algorithm`) to solve a problem
- Generalise important detail so that algorithms can be made re-usable (this process is called `abstraction`)

#### Audience

This workshop is for researchers at all career stages who want to understand the uses and the building blocks of computational thinking. This skill is useful for all kinds of problem solving, whether in real life or in computing. 

The workshop will not teach computer programming *per se*. Instead it will cover the thought processes involved should you want to learn to program. 

#### Prerequisites

All you will need to complete this workshop is a pen and paper. All the practice exercises can be done without a computer.

#### Assumed knowledge

No prior knowledge is assumed. Use the [glossary](content/7-glossary.html) to familiarise yourself with the meaning of terms like `abstraction` and `algorithm`.
