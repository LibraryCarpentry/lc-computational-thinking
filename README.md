This lesson was ported from Belinda Weaver's [Intro to Computational Thinking](https://github.com/weaverbel/intro-computational-thinking). Her original lesson can be found at the provided link, and this version is adapted into The Carpentries format.

## Topic and aims

**An Introduction to Computational Thinking**

Once you have completed this workshop, you should be able to:

- Identify the steps involved in computational thinking
- Break a problem down into more manageable pieces
- Develop an algorithm to solve the problem
- Use abstraction to make the algorithm reusable

The workshop will not teach computer programming *per se*. Instead, it will cover the thought processes involved should you want to learn to program.

## Audience

This workshop is aimed at researchers at all stages who want to understand the building blocks of computational thinking.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this workshop you will need: 

- A pen and paper

## Assumed knowledge

No prior knowledge is assumed. 

## Why?

Rather than making slides for a workshop, why not create a website? It's easier to write, access, share, and reuse. GitHub and GitHub Pages make this pretty easy.

It is a better Open Educational Resource since anyone can make a copy and adapt it!
